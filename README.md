# YVR_Energy_Prediction
# Project description

**Objective**  

The main goal of this project is to develop a model to forecast monthly energy use for the Vancouver International Airport (YVR).  

**Introduction**  

Budget planning at YVR requires forecasting the cost of energy to operate the airport. An accurate forecast could help the YVR representatives negotiate more favourable contracts with energy suppliers.

**Data Available**  

Data was taken from 14 years of records from the YVR database. This data set includes information on date, energy use, temperature, terminal area, and number of passengers. Data have been aggregated by month into 168 records (14 years with 12 months each).  

| # | Variable | Definition |  
| :- | :- | :- |  
| 1 | month | Month and year, e.g.: Nov-98 |
| 2 | energy | Energy use measured in thousands of kilowatt hours (kWh) |
| 3 | mean.temp | Mean monthly temperature outside (degrees Celsius) |
| 4 | total.area | Total area of all terminals (sq. m.) |
| 5 | total.passengers | Total number of passengers in thousands |
| 6 | domestic.passengers | Total number of domestic passengers (traveling within Canada) in thousands |
| 7 | US.passengers | Total number of passengers traveling between Canada and the US in thousands |
